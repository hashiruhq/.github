Hashiru Exchange
================

We're a small team of developers that worked on various fintech products mainly in the crypto space.
Through those opportunities we've build products that are actively used by the crypto community.

We love open source software and with Hashiru Exchange we're looking to improve the quality of 
open source crypto exchanges and have constructive discussions with community members.

In 2017 we built a matching engine in Go that could process up to 1.000.000 orders per second as the
answer to a challenge launched by a potential client that it could only be done in C++ or Java.

The code for a more enhanced version of that is available in the [engine repository](https://github.com/hashiruhq/engine).
We're looking to improve on that codebase and add support for multiple communication channels and protocols.
The engine is currently running in production for 5 years for an italian crypto exchange.

If you are building an exchange and would like to see how we can help feel free to [contact us](mailto:cosmin@around25.com).

Another critical part of the exchange represents managing the crypto wallets and receiving deposits.
For that we have a separate repository as a wrapper around Bitgo that makes it easy to separe the communication
with various blockchains and the internal functionality of your fintec product.

We're always open to share ideas and consult on other projects. [Reach out with any questions](mailto:cosmin@around25.com).
